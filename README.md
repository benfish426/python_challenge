# python_challenge
Homework 3

Code for this challenge was inspired from examples in our class.

For the writing to a textfile component of the assignment, I received help from AskBCS on Slack. I was using writerow (csv file) but was given the feedback to correct my code and successfully output my data.

I also discussed my code with James (TA) to figure out how to correctly display the output file in PyPoll.

I rewatched videos from our class on how to successfully upload files to github through the terminal.
